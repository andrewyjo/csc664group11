exports filenames into previous folder(use ../(or a different dir) because saving it in the same folder will cause parsing issues)
ls >> ../filenames.txt

timestamps
for file in ./*; do exiftool  $file|grep 'Date/Time Original'; done >> ../timestamps.txt

filesizes in bytes
for file in ./*; do  exiftool -n -filesize# $file; done >> filesizes.txt

mimetypes(file type)
for file in ./*; do  exiftool -mimetype# $file; done | awk '{print $4}' >> mimetypes.txt


I used vim to delete all overhead info in the txtfile and copied it directly into workbench
